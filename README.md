# odin-recipes

18/11/21 Attempting the first project on Odin, after a 6 month break since I completed the previous lessons and assignments. What could go wrong?

Update: Completed the HTML sections relatively straightforwardly but 6 months is clearly longer than my brain retains git knowledge for. Adding and committing was a bit of a git. Found the relevant lesson and worked through it though.
